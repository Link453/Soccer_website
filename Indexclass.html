         <p>I like soccer, in soccer theres a field and 2 nets you have to bring the ball without your hands to the other net and dribble past defenders if the defenders get it they have to do the same and your team becomes defenders each team has a goal keeper that stands in the net to block the shots in some other places in the world soccer is called football.
